    <p class="textpara">I'm <b>Atharva Honrao</b>, the IT whizz from Thadomal Shahani Engineering College! 🤓 I'm all
        about that app and web development life and I'm totally stoked about it! <br> <br>

        When I'm not buried in my coding adventures, you'll probably catch me doing some competitive programming. Yeah,
        I'm that guy who loves to crack those mind-bending challenges! 💻<br> <br>

        But hey, it's not all work and no play! I've got some awesome hobbies to keep me sane. First off, kite flying!
        It might sound old-school, but trust me, it's super fun and brings out the kid in me! 🪁 And of course, I can't
        live without my dose of music. 🎵 It pumps me up and keeps me going! Oh, and did I mention I'm a total gaming
        geek? Yeah, I dive into virtual worlds whenever I get the chance! 🎮<br> <br>

        I'm always up for connecting with cool people who share my passions or just wanna chat tech and stuff. So, don't
        be shy, drop me a message, and let's geek out together! 🚀</p>
